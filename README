Liquibase extension that provides support for  SAP Hana DB.

Initial Hana DB support is currently implemented in the 2.0.x and 3.0.x branches. The master branch at the moment follows 3.4.x and it's built against version 3.4.2 of Liquibase.

The original Liquibase distribution is available at: https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/

The official liquibase site is: http://www.liquibase.org

Released under the Apache 2.0 License with no guarantee whatsoever.

This is currently used in some projects I have been involved with. Branch 3.0.x has definitely undergone more testing at this point, but 2.0.x is still used in production with good results.
If you give it a go, I'd like to know how it worked for you.

It's available from Maven Central. If you are using maven, add the following dependency:

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.lbitonti</groupId>
  <artifactId>liquibase-hana</artifactId>
